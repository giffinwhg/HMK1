# HMK1

LAB 1 README:

I implemented all the shapes required:
plane
cube
sphere
cone
cylinder
torus (extra credit)

tasks completed:
I created a robot similar to the robot mentioned in the lab (see images 1 or 2 in the lab assignment)

extra credit:
Torus

Tessellation extra credit:
I Did the Graduate student portion of the project where I generated all of the triangles using 3D triangles 
(and in result created a mesh). I did this to what I thought was being asked as the definition of tessellation can involve the 
resolution of the object or the manner in drawing based off of required detail. Both indicators are mentioned so I picked one.
The resolution of the tessellation is defined in the method calls (headers) for the following shapes:

sphere
torus
cone
cylinder


robot rendering: 
there are some pre defined macro methods I created to aid the rendering of the arms and legs. 
They define the shape and size of the arms/legs etc.

I also am using a macro for the rendering of the body like I mentioned above. 

NOTE:

I submitted the visual studio project because it contains all the necessary files etc to run the project. 
I have tested it and all you need to do is import the project into visual studio, build, and run. 
If that does not work (because sometimes weird stuff like this happens) let me know and I can demo it to you in class.
